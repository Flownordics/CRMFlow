# Kanban Board Issue Fix - Summary

## Problem
When dragging deals in the kanban board, multiple deals were being moved to a new stage even though only one deal was being dragged.

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. **Duplicate Position Values** ✅ FIXED
The database had multiple deals with the same `position` value within the same stage. For example:
- 5 deals in "Prospecting" all had `position = 4`
- 2 deals in "Negotiation" had `position = 1`

This caused ordering issues and potentially unexpected behavior during the reorder operations.

### 2. **Lack of Database Constraints** ✅ FIXED
The database lacked:
- Validation that only exactly 1 deal is affected during stage changes
- Unique constraint to prevent duplicate positions
- Proper error handling in the reorder function

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Database Migration ✅ APPLIED
**File:** `database/migrations/20251015000000_fix_duplicate_positions.sql`

- **Fixed all duplicate positions** - Reassigned sequential positions (0, 1, 2, 3...) to all deals within each stage
- **Added unique index** - Prevents duplicate positions in the future:
  ```sql
  CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_deals_stage_position_unique 
    ON public.deals (stage_id, position) 
    WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;
  ```
- **Improved reorder_deal function** with:
  - Input parameter validation (null checks, non-negative index)
  - Verification that target stage exists
  - **ROW COUNT verification** - Ensures exactly 1 deal is affected when changing stages
  - Better error messages with `RAISE EXCEPTION`
  - Added `deleted_at IS NULL` checks to all WHERE clauses
  - Automatic `updated_at` timestamp updates

### 2. Enhanced Frontend Logging ✅ IMPLEMENTED
**Files:** 
- `src/components/deals/KanbanBoard.tsx`
- `src/services/deals.ts`

Added comprehensive debug logging to track:
- Which deal ID is being dragged (`onDragStart`)
- What parameters are sent to the mutation (`onDragEnd`)
- API call parameters and responses (`rpcReorderDeal`)
- Mutation success/failure status (`useMoveDeal`)

This logging will help diagnose any future issues by showing the exact flow of operations.

## Verification

### Database Verification ✅ PASSED
```sql
-- No duplicate positions found after migration
SELECT stage_id, position, COUNT(*) as count
FROM deals
WHERE deleted_at IS NULL
GROUP BY stage_id, position
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
-- Returns: [] (empty - no duplicates)
```

All deals now have unique, sequential positions within their stages:
- Prospecting: positions 0-9 (10 deals)
- Proposal: positions 0-6 (7 deals)
- Negotiation: positions 0-3 (4 deals)
- Lost: positions 0-3 (4 deals)

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Test Basic Drag & Drop
1. Open the Deals board
2. Drag a single deal from one stage to another
3. **Expected:** Only that one deal should move
4. Check browser console for debug logs showing the operation

### 2. Test Within Same Stage
1. Drag a deal to a different position within the same stage
2. **Expected:** Deal should reorder correctly
3. Other deals should shift positions but remain in the same stage

### 3. Test Multiple Rapid Drags
1. Quickly drag multiple deals one after another
2. **Expected:** Each drag should only affect the dragged deal
3. No "ghost" movements of other deals

### 4. Check Database Integrity
Run this query after testing:
```sql
-- Should return no results (no duplicates)
SELECT stage_id, position, COUNT(*) as count, array_agg(title) as deals
FROM deals
WHERE deleted_at IS NULL
GROUP BY stage_id, position
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

## Safeguards in Place

### Database Level
1. ✅ **Unique index** prevents duplicate positions
2. ✅ **Row lock** (`FOR UPDATE`) prevents race conditions
3. ✅ **Row count verification** ensures exactly 1 deal is moved
4. ✅ **Exception handling** with clear error messages
5. ✅ **Deleted records filtering** in all queries

### Application Level
1. ✅ **Memoized components** prevent unnecessary re-renders
2. ✅ **Stable deal IDs** used throughout
3. ✅ **Query invalidation** after successful mutations
4. ✅ **Comprehensive logging** for debugging
5. ✅ **Activation constraint** on drag sensor (10px distance before drag starts)

## What Was NOT Changed

- The core drag-and-drop logic in KanbanBoard (it was already correct)
- The React Query caching strategy (it's working as expected)
- The RLS (Row Level Security) policies (they were correct)
- The UI/UX of the kanban board

## Monitoring

The enhanced logging will show in the browser console:
- `[KanbanBoard]` - Drag operations and state
- `[rpcReorderDeal]` - API calls with parameters and responses
- `[useMoveDeal]` - Mutation lifecycle events

If issues persist, these logs will help identify:
- Which deal ID is being affected
- What parameters are being sent to the database
- Whether the issue is frontend or backend

## Rollback Plan

If needed, the migration can be rolled back by:
1. Dropping the unique index:
   ```sql
   DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_deals_stage_position_unique;
   ```
2. Reverting to the old reorder_deal function:
   ```sql
   -- See database/create_reorder_deal_function.sql
   ```

However, this would reintroduce the possibility of duplicate positions.

## Conclusion

The issue has been comprehensively addressed through:
1. ✅ Fixing existing data corruption (duplicate positions)
2. ✅ Preventing future data corruption (unique constraint)
3. ✅ Adding database-level safeguards (row count validation)
4. ✅ Enhanced observability (comprehensive logging)

**The kanban board should now work correctly with only the dragged deal moving between stages.**

## Technical Details

### Improved `reorder_deal` Function Highlights

```sql
-- Validates exactly 1 row is affected
GET DIAGNOSTICS v_affected_rows = ROW_COUNT;
IF v_affected_rows <> 1 THEN
    RAISE EXCEPTION 'unexpected number of rows affected: % (expected 1)', v_affected_rows;
END IF;
```

This is the critical safeguard that prevents multiple deals from having their `stage_id` changed simultaneously. If somehow the WHERE clause matches more than one deal, the function will raise an exception and roll back the transaction.
