$env:SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN="your-token-here"

# 2. Run deployment
.\deploy-google-functions.ps1
```

**Option B: Manual Deployment**
```powershell
npx supabase functions deploy google-oauth-start --no-verify-jwt
npx supabase functions deploy google-oauth-callback --no-verify-jwt

**Functions to Deploy:**
- [ ] `google-oauth-start`
- [ ] `google-oauth-callback`
- [ ] `google-refresh`

---

## ‚úÖ Post-Deployment Testing

### 1. Run Test Script
```powershell
.\test-google-oauth.ps1
```

Expected: All functions should be accessible (‚úÖ)

### 2. Test OAuth Flow - Gmail

1. [ ] Navigate to: https://crmflow-app.netlify.app/settings
2. [ ] Click **"Integrations"** tab
3. [ ] See the blue banner about Google integration update (can dismiss it)
4. [ ] Click **"Connect Gmail"** button
5. [ ] Redirected to Google OAuth consent screen
6. [ ] Select your Google account
7. [ ] Click **"Allow"** to grant permissions
8. [ ] Redirected back to your app
9. [ ] See **"Connected as [your-email@gmail.com]"** in Settings
10. [ ] Badge shows **"Connected"** in green

### 3. Test OAuth Flow - Calendar

1. [ ] In Settings ‚Üí Integrations
2. [ ] Click **"Connect Calendar"** button
3. [ ] Authorize with Google account
4. [ ] See **"Connected as [your-email@gmail.com]"**
5. [ ] Badge shows **"Connected"** in green

### 4. Test Gmail Send Functionality

1. [ ] Navigate to Quotes or Invoices
2. [ ] Create or open a quote/invoice
3. [ ] Click **"Send via Email"** button
4. [ ] Email dialog shows: **"Sending as [your-email@gmail.com]"**
5. [ ] Enter recipient email
6. [ ] Click **"Send"**
7. [ ] Success message appears
8. [ ] **Check recipient's inbox** - email should arrive
9. [ ] **Check "From" address** - should be YOUR Gmail, not app owner's

### 5. Test Calendar Sync Functionality

1. [ ] Navigate to Calendar view
2. [ ] Click **"New Event"** button
3. [ ] Fill in event details:
   - Title: "Test OAuth Event"
   - Start time: Tomorrow at 10:00 AM
   - End time: Tomorrow at 11:00 AM
4. [ ] Click **"Create"**
5. [ ] Event appears in CRM calendar
6. [ ] **Open your Google Calendar** (calendar.google.com)
7. [ ] Verify event appears there too
8. [ ] Edit event in CRM ‚Üí changes sync to Google
9. [ ] Delete event in CRM ‚Üí removed from Google

### 6. Verify Token Encryption

```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
SELECT 
  user_id,
  kind,
  email,
  LENGTH(access_token) as token_length,
  LENGTH(refresh_token) as refresh_length,
  expires_at > NOW() as is_valid
FROM user_integrations
WHERE provider = 'google'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- ‚úÖ Expected: token_length should be 200+ characters (encrypted)
-- ‚ùå If 150-180 characters, tokens are not encrypted (check ENCRYPTION_KEY)
```

### 7. Test Token Refresh

1. [ ] Wait a few minutes
2. [ ] Send another email or create calendar event
3. [ ] Should work without re-authentication
4. [ ] Check Edge Function logs: should see "Token refreshed successfully" if it was near expiration

### 8. Test Multiple Users (if available)

1. [ ] Have a second user connect their Gmail
2. [ ] First user sends email ‚Üí sent from first user's Gmail
3. [ ] Second user sends email ‚Üí sent from second user's Gmail
4. [ ] ‚úÖ Emails correctly sent from respective user accounts

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: "No OAuth credentials configured"

**Symptoms:** Error when clicking "Connect Gmail/Calendar"

**Fix:**
1. Check environment variables are set in Supabase Dashboard
2. Redeploy Edge Functions
3. Clear browser cache and try again

### Issue: "redirect_uri_mismatch"

**Symptoms:** Error from Google after clicking "Allow"

**Fix:**
1. Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
2. Edit your OAuth 2.0 Client
3. Verify redirect URI is EXACTLY: `https://rgimekaxpmqqlqulhpgt.supabase.co/functions/v1/google-oauth-callback`
4. Save and try again

### Issue: Email sent but "From" is wrong address

**Symptoms:** Email sent from app owner's address instead of user's

**Fix:**
1. This shouldn't happen with the new implementation
2. Disconnect and reconnect Gmail integration
3. Check Edge Function logs for errors
4. Verify user has their own `user_integrations` record

### Issue: Tokens not encrypted in database

**Symptoms:** Token length in DB is 150-180 characters

**Fix:**
1. Verify `ENCRYPTION_KEY` is set in Supabase environment variables
2. Redeploy Edge Functions
3. Users must disconnect and reconnect to get encrypted tokens

### Issue: "Token refresh failed"

**Symptoms:** Errors after ~1 hour of first connection

**Fix:**
1. Check if `refresh_token` exists in `user_integrations` table
2. If missing, user needs to reconnect (with `prompt=consent`)
3. Check `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` is correct in environment variables

---

## üìä Monitoring

### Check Edge Function Logs

**Via Dashboard:**
1. Go to: Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Edge Functions
2. Click on a function (e.g., `google-oauth-callback`)
3. Click **"Logs"** tab
4. Look for errors or warnings

**Via CLI:**
```powershell
npx supabase functions logs google-oauth-callback --follow
```

### Check Integration Status (SQL)

```sql
-- See all connected users
SELECT 
  ui.user_id,
  ui.kind,
  ui.email,
  ui.expires_at,
  ui.last_synced_at,
  au.email as user_email
FROM user_integrations ui
JOIN auth.users au ON ui.user_id = au.id
WHERE ui.provider = 'google'
  AND ui.access_token IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY ui.updated_at DESC;
```
